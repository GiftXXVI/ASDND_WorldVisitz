					<h2>What is an Agile Methodology?</h2>
					<p class="text-left">Agile methodologies are based on the Agile Manifesto.
						They have increased focus on:
					<ol>
						<li>Engagement with business users. </li>
						<li>Delivery of business value.</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is the Agile Manifesto?</h3>
					<span class="small">In 2001, a group of software developers met to find common
						ground among their
						methodologies. This common ground
						became the <b>Agile Manifesto</b>. It states that they value:</span></p>
					<table class="table table-bordered table-sm small">

					<h2>So, How will WorldVisitz benefit from Agile?</h2>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Agile uses iterations to deliver small partial increments of the whole application thus
							ensuring that at least part of
							the application is delivered early and that the customer starts seeing the system and
							receiving business value from it early.
						</li>
						<li>
							Waterfall fixes requirements at the beginning of the project and assumes that there will
							be no change in the customer's
							requirements then proceeds in phases, creating the full application at one go.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Waterfall?</h2>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>A waterfall methodology is sequential, phased process for software development where each
							phase produces a milestone that triggers the start of the next and a phase is not redone
							after it is completed.</li>
						<li>Once requirements are established, they become a contract between the developer and the
							customer and it is almost impossible to change them after that.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Waterfall Vs Agile</h2>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Waterfall works well when both the customer's requirements and technology for implementation
							are
							well known.</li>
						<li>If the requirements are not well understood or the technology is not well known, then Agile
							works
							well.</li>
						<li>
							If both the requirements and the technology are unknown, then the project is in chaos and
							management has to intervene to ensure that at least one of the 2 is well understood then
							Agile can
							be used from that point.</li>
					</ul>
