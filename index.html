				<h2>WorldVisitz Agile Proposal</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h3>Part 1: The Background</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Current Situation</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>The development team collects requirements at the beginning of the project and
							write a specification. They validate the specification with business users, freeze the
							specification and use it as input to design.</li>
						<li>At this point, they freeze the requirements and use them to
							create designs for the business logic and user experience.They also validate these with
							the users.</li>
						<li>Then they freeze the design and implement it, test the implementation, fixing errors
							and deploy the tested implementation for the business users to validate, accept and
							adopt it.
						</li>
						</ol>
						</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The Downside</h3>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>The first version of the system will only be seen after 18 months.
							<ul class="small">
								<li>If we realize that some requirements have changed or some things are missing or we
									have added excess features, we can only realize and fix it after 18 months.</li>
								<li>At any point past the validation of each phase, you will not be able to request
									changes to the requirements.</li>
								<li>If we identify opportunities for improvement, to add business value through the
									application, we will not be able to capitalize on them during these 18 months. </li>

								</ol>
						</li>
						</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The Solution</h3>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>We switch to an Agile Methodology.</li>
						<ul class="small">
							<li>We will build the application in iterations, with each iteration producing a new
								increment of our application.</li>
							<li>We will empower our developers to discuss work among themselves and allocate and deliver
								it while sharing expertise among themselves.</li>
							<li>With this schedule, we will start seeing parts of the application and business value
								immediately after the first increment.</li>
							<li>As we see more of the application, we will discover incorrect assumptions and
								implementations and we will correct it in future increments</li>
							<li>Eventually, we will have an application that matches business requirements and is able
								to adapt rapidly to new business requirements.</li>
						</ul>
						</ol>
				</section>

					<h3>Part 2: Transformation</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is an Agile Methodology?</h3>
					<p class="small text-left">Agile methodologies are based on the Agile Manifesto.
						They have increased focus on:
					<ol class="small">
						<li>Engagement with business users. </li>
						<li>Delivery of business value.</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What is the Agile Manifesto?</h3>
					<span class="small">In 2001, a group of software developers met to find common
						ground among their
						methodologies. This common ground
						became the <b>Agile Manifesto</b>. The Manifesto says they value:</span></p>
					<table class="table table-bordered table-sm small">
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Individuals and interactions</td>
								<td rowspan="4" class="align-middle"><span
										class="font-weight-bold display-5">Over</span></td>
								<td>processes and tools</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Working software</td>
								<td>
									comprehensive documentation.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Customer collaboration</td>
								<td>
									contract negotiation.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Responding to change</td>
								<td>
									following a plan.
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why we should follow the Manifesto</h3>
					<p class="small">
					<ul>
						<li>It recognises that:</li>

						<ul class="small">
							<li><b>People</b> build software with their domain knowledge and technical skills.
							</li>
							<li><b>Working software</b> brings the most business value of all project
								deliverables.</li>
							<li><b>Requirements are bound to change over time</b> and as our understanding improves.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Having the right priorities leads to consistent, predictable and
							repeatable success.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Long Before Agile, There was Waterfall</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>
							In the waterfall methodology, requirements are collected from customers, stakeholders and
							users at the beginning of a project and a fixed linear sequential schedule of phases is
							followed to design, create, test and deploy the product.
						</li>

					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The problems with Waterfall</h3>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>Once requirements are established, they become a contract between the developer(s) and the
							customer and it is almost impossible to change them.</li>
						<li>The output of each phase is a milestone that terminates the current phase and serves as the
							(required) initial input to the next phase. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								At the end of each phase, the milestone(or deliverable) is reviewed.
							</li>
							<li>If a milestone is approved, the work of the phase is
								not redone. Even if requirements change.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>How Agile Fixes Waterfall's Problems</h3>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>In contrast Agile allows and anticipates changes in requirements at any point in the
							development process.</li>
						<li>Agile also includes Business Users in the developement team and encourages collaboration
							and constant communication thus feedback is immediate.</li>
						<li>Agile is incremental and iterative by design so there are many reviews to learn from and
							there are many opportunities to incorporate feedback into future iterations.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>When to use Waterfall (and Agile)</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>Waterfall works well when both the customer's requirements and technology for implementation
							are
							well known.</li>
						<li>Agile is recommended if either:
							<ul>
								<li>the requirements are not well understood</li> or
								<li>the technology is not well known</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If both requirements and technology are unclear, first clarify at least one.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>How will WorldVisitz benefit from Agile?</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>
							Agile uses iterations to deliver small increments of the whole application, learning from
							the feedback of previous increments to make future increments and improve previous
							increments</li>
						<li> This ensures that at least part of
							the application is delivered early and that the customer starts seeing the system and
							receiving business value from it early.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Part 3: Optimization</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Kanban</h3>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>Kanban is based on Lean Product Development.</li>
						<li>Lean Product Development and Kanban aim to minimise waste and maximize productivity.</li>
						<li>Kanban requires transparency of work, therefore work items are posted on a Kanban board.
						</li>
						<li>A Kanban team focuses on work in progress and requires minimization of number of items in
							work in progress to
							match the capacity of the team.</li>
						<li>The main benefits for WorldVizits are that Lean (and Kanban) emphasize</li>
						<ul class="small">
							<li>Creation and Transfer of Knowledge among the team.</li>
							<li> Respect for people; allowing them to
								solve problems by themselves (thus empowering the team).</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>

								<th>Framework</th>
