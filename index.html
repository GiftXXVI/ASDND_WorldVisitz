						### How WorldVisitz Can Benefit From Agile?

						### What is Agile?
						A new approach to developing software.  
						Also applicable to product development in general.  
						Agile increases the focus on:  
						1. Engagement with business users. 
						2. Delivery of business value.

						### The Agile Manifesto
						After years of developing software, the the developers who created 
						the Agile methodology discovered that:
						- Individuals and interactions generate more value than processes and tools.
						- Working software is more valuable than comprehensive documentation.
						- Customer collaboration delivers more value than contract negotiation.
						- Responding to change creates more value than following a plan.

						### So, How will WorldVisitz benefit from Agile?
						- Agile uses iterations to deliver small partial increments of the whole application thus ensuring that at least part of 
						the application is delivered early and that the customer starts seeing the system and receiving business value from it early.
						- Waterfall fixes requirements at the beginning of the project and assumes that there will be no change in the customer's 
						requirements then proceeds in phases, creating the full application at one go.

						### Waterfall?
						A waterfall methodology is sequential, phased process for software development where each phase produces a milestone that triggers the start of the next and a phase is not redone after it is completed.

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						- Waterfall works well when both the customer's requirements and technology for implementation are well known. 
						- If the requirements are not well understood or the technology is not well known, then Agile works well. 
						- If both the requirements and the technology are unknown, then the project is in chaos and management has to intervene to ensure that at least one of the 2 is well understood then Agile can be used from that point.
